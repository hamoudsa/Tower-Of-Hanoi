The puzzle starts with the disk in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one road, the smallest at the top, also called Tower of Brahma or Lucasâ€™ Tower.

The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another road or tower, obeying the following simple rules:
Only one disk can be moved at a time.
